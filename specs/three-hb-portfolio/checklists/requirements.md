- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Validated**: 2025-11-04

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the planning phase.

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while maintaining clarity
- User stories are well-prioritized (P1: Landing, P2: Navigation, P3: Interaction)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases comprehensively cover browser compatibility, performance, and error scenarios
- Assumptions clearly define scope boundaries and technical baseline
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
